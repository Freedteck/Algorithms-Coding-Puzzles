1. Start by defining the initial state of the cellular automaton as a 2D array called `startState`.

2. Print the start state by calling the `printLayout` method with the `startState` as the input.

3. Create an empty list called `layouts` to store the layouts encountered during the simulation.

4. Add the `startState` to the `layouts` list.

5. Initialize a variable `minute` to 1 to keep track of the simulation time.

6. Enter an infinite loop (which will be terminated when a repeated layout is encountered).

7. Inside the loop, get the last layout from the `layouts` list using `layouts.get(layouts.size() - 1)`.

8. Generate the next layout for the next minute by calling the `nextMinuteLayout` method with the last layout as the input.

9. Check if the new layout is already present in the `layouts` list by calling the `containsLayout` method with `layouts` and the new layout as inputs.

10. If the new layout is already present:
    - Print the current minute.
    - Print the new layout by calling the `printLayout` method with the new layout as the input.
    - Display a message indicating that a repeated layout has been encountered.
    - Calculate the lifeform score for the layout by calling the `calculateLifeformScore` method with the new layout as the input.
    - Print the lifeform score.
    - Break out of the loop.

11. If the new layout is not present in the `layouts` list:
    - Add it to the `layouts` list.
    - Print the current minute.
    - Print the new layout by calling the `printLayout` method with the new layout as the input.
    - Increment the `minute` variable.

12. Repeat steps 7 to 11 until a repeated layout is encountered.

13. The simulation is complete.

14. The `printLayout` method:
    - Takes a 2D array (layout) as input.
    - Iterates over each row in the layout.
    - Prints each row followed by an empty line.

15. The `nextMinuteLayout` method:
    - Takes a 2D array (layout) as input.
    - Creates a new 2D array called `newLayout`.
    - Iterates over each cell in the current layout.
    - Counts the adjacent lifeforms and empty spaces.
    - Applies the rules to update the cell in the new layout.
    - Returns the new layout.

16. The `containsLayout` method:
    - Takes a list of layouts and a target layout as inputs.
    - Iterates over each layout in the list.
    - Uses the `areLayoutsEqual` method to compare them.
    - If a matching layout is found, it returns `true`.
    - Otherwise, it returns `false`.

17. The `areLayoutsEqual` method:
    - Takes two layouts as inputs.
    - Compares each cell of the layouts.
    - If any cells differ, it returns `false`, indicating that the layouts are not equal.
    - If all cells are the same, it returns `true`, indicating that the layouts are equal.
