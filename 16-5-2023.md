1. Start by defining the initial state of the cellular automaton as a 2D array called `startState`.

2. Print the start state by calling the `printLayout` method with the `startState` as the input.

3. Create an empty list called `layouts` to store the layouts encountered during the simulation.

4. Add the `startState` to the `layouts` list.

5. Initialize a variable `minute` to 1 to keep track of the simulation time.

6. Enter an infinite loop (which will be terminated when a repeated layout is encountered).

7. Inside the loop, get the last layout from the `layouts` list using `layouts.get(layouts.size() - 1)`.

8. Generate the next layout for the next minute by calling the `nextMinuteLayout` method with the last layout as the input.

9. Check if the new layout is already present in the `layouts` list by calling the `containsLayout` method with `layouts` and the new layout as inputs.

10. If the new layout is already present, print the current minute, print the new layout, and display a message indicating that a repeated layout has been encountered. Then, break out of the loop.

11. If the new layout is not present in the `layouts` list, add it to the `layouts` list, print the current minute, print the new layout, and increment the `minute` variable.

12. Repeat steps 7 to 11 until a repeated layout is encountered.

13. The simulation is complete.

14. The `printLayout` method takes a 2D array (layout) as input and prints each row of the layout followed by an empty line.

15. The `nextMinuteLayout` method takes a 2D array (layout) as input and generates the layout for the next minute based on the rules of the cellular automaton. It iterates over each cell in the current layout, counts the adjacent lifeforms and empty spaces, and applies the rules to update the cell in the new layout. The new layout is returned.

16. The `containsLayout` method takes a list of layouts and a target layout as inputs. It iterates over each layout in the list and uses the `areLayoutsEqual` method to compare them. If a matching layout is found, it returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`.

17. The `areLayoutsEqual` method takes two layouts as inputs and compares each cell of the layouts. If any cells differ, it returns `false`, indicating that the layouts are not equal. If all cells are the same, it returns `true`, indicating that the layouts are equal.
