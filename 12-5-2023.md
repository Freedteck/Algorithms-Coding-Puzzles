1. Create an empty StringBuilder object to store the decoded string.
2. Initialize the loop index i to 0.
3. While i is less than the length of the encoded string, repeat steps 4-7:
4.   Set matchFound to false.
5.   For each symbol in the codebook, repeat steps 6-8:
6.     Get the code for the current symbol from the codebook.
7.     If the encoded string starting at index i matches the current code, then:
8.       Append the current symbol to the StringBuilder object, move the loop index i forward by the length of the code, set matchFound to true, and break out of the symbol loop.
9.   If matchFound is still false, then throw an exception indicating that the encoding is invalid.
10. Return the decoded string as a string from the StringBuilder object.
