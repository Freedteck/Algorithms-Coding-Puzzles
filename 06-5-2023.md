1. Initialize variables for each runner's speed, run time, and rest time
2. Initialize variables for each runner's distance traveled and time elapsed
3. Loop through 1234 seconds
4. Within the loop, calculate the distance traveled by each runner based on whether they are running or resting
5. Determine the winner based on which runner has traveled the farthest distance at the end of the loop
6. Print the distance traveled by each runner and the name of the winner
