1. Create a function named "getMinimumCost" that accepts an integer array named "efficiency".

2. Initialize a variable named "n" and assign it the length of the input array.

3. Initialize a variable named "minCost" with the maximum value of an integer and a variable named "excludeIndex" with -1.

4. Loop through each worker index i from 0 to n-1.

5. Create a copy of the efficiency array and store it in a variable named "copy".

6. Store the efficiency of the worker at the index "i" in a variable named "excludeEfficiency".

7. Set the efficiency of the worker at the index "i" in the "copy" array to -1 to exclude the worker.

8. Initialize a variable named "cost" to 0.

9. Loop through the workers from 0 to n-1 in increments of 2.

10. Find the two workers with the highest efficiency remaining in the "copy" array and store their indices in variables named "first" and "second".

11. Update the "cost" variable with the absolute difference of their efficiencies.

12. Set the efficiency of the workers at the indices "first" and "second" in the "copy" array to -1 to exclude them.

13. If the "cost" variable is less than the "minCost" variable, update the "minCost" variable with the "cost" variable and update the "excludeIndex" variable with the current worker index "i".

14. Return the "minCost" variable.

15. Print the efficiency of the worker to be excluded based on the "excludeIndex" variable.
