1. Initialize the input string to "1867".

2. Initialize a boolean variable foundDivisible to false, a variable smallest to the maximum possible integer value, and a variable largest to the minimum possible integer value. Also, initialize a variable count to zero.

3. Loop over all possible permutations of the digits in the input string, using four nested loops. The outermost loop iterates over the first digit, the second loop iterates over the second digit, and so on.

4. For each permutation, convert it to an integer and check if it is divisible by 7 using the modulo operator (%).

5. If the permutation is divisible by 7, set foundDivisible to true, update the smallest and largest values if necessary, and increment the count.

6. After all permutations have been checked, if foundDivisible is true, calculate the average of the smallest and largest values using the formula (smallest + largest) / 2.0.

7. Print the count of values divisible by 7, the smallest value, the largest value, and the average (if any).

8. If foundDivisible is false, print a message indicating that there are no permutations of the input string that are divisible by 7.
