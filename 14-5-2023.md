1. Start by defining a function called `findMinimumDeletion` that takes the left index `l`, right index `r`, a memoization array `dp`, and the input string `s` as input parameters.

2. Check if there are no nodes between the left and right indices (i.e., `l > r`). If so, return 0 since no deletion is needed.

3. Check if there is only one node at the left and right indices (i.e., `l == r`). If so, return 1 as deleting that node is sufficient.

4. Check if the minimum number of deletions for the current substring (from index `l` to index `r`) has already been computed and stored in the `dp` array. If so, return the stored value. This helps avoid redundant calculations.

5. Initialize a variable `res` with the value of 1 plus the minimum number of deletions for the substring starting from the next index (i.e., `l + 1`) to the current right index `r`. This represents the case when a single character is deleted from the substring.

6. Iterate through each index `i` from `l + 1` to `r`:
   - Compare the character at index `l` with the character at index `i`. If they are equal, we have a potential deletion scenario.
   - Consider two scenarios for deletion:
     - Deleting the characters between `l` and `i` (excluding `l` and `i`) by calling `findMinimumDeletion` recursively with the updated left index (`l + 1`) and the new right index (`i - 1`). This represents the deletion of characters in the middle of the substring.
     - Deleting the characters starting from index `i` by calling `findMinimumDeletion` recursively with the updated left index (`i`) and the same right index (`r`). This represents the deletion of characters after `l`.
   - Update `res` with the minimum value between `res` and the sum of the two deletion scenarios mentioned above.

7. Store the calculated minimum number of deletions (`res`) in the `dp` array at the corresponding indices (`l`, `r`) for future reference. This memoization step helps avoid redundant calculations for the same substring.

8. Return the minimum number of deletions (`res`) for the current substring (from index `l` to index `r`).
